Two Sum Problem

Original Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Return an empty array if no two numbers add to a specific target.

```javascript
twoSum([1, 2, 5, 6, 9], 10) // -> [0, 4]
twoSum([-3, -1, 2, 9, 11], -4) // -> [0, 1]

twoSum([-4, 1, 2, 9], 2) // -> []
twoSum([-9, -2, 4, 10], 100) // -> []
```
